<p>I completed my elementary education at San Roque Elementary School, where I acquired a solid foundation in academic principles and personal development. Transitioning to secondary education, I pursued my studies at Ibayiw Integrated National High School<br><br>
Building upon my secondary education, I am currently enrolled at (LSPU-SPCC), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BS-IT). As a diligent second-year student, I am committed to achieving academic excellence. With a projected graduation year of 2026, I am eager to continue my educational journey and make meaningful contributions to the dynamic and ever-evolving technology industry.  </p>
